# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Migrate versioning from static `pyproject.toml` field to `setuptools-scm` — version is now derived automatically from git tags.
- Redesign release pipeline into three workflow files:
  - `_build.yml` — reusable build workflow (test + package via setuptools-scm)
  - `staging.yml` — `release/*` branch pushes publish to TestPyPI and verify install
  - `release.yml` — `v*` tag pushes publish to TestPyPI, then PyPI (with approval gate), then create GitHub Release
- Add CLI smoke test in staging/release verify step (`agentops --version`, `agentops --help`, `agentops init`).
- Fix secret reference from `PIPY_TOKEN` to `PYPI_TOKEN`; add `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN` for TestPyPI.
- Add consistent workflow index header across all CI/CD workflow files.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-__-__

### Changed
- Split `agentops init` dataset seeds into `.agentops/datasets/` for YAML definitions and `.agentops/data/` for JSONL rows, and updated docs/examples to use the new layout.
- Expanded `agentops init` run-config seeds to include scenario-specific examples: `.agentops/run-rag.yaml` and `.agentops/run-agent.yaml` in addition to the default `.agentops/run.yaml`.
- Removed the runtime fallback to `gpt-5-mini` in the Foundry backend; model-direct mode now requires an explicit deployment via `backend.model` or `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
- Added planned CLI command stubs with friendly "not implemented in this release" messages, and documented command availability/status in README and architecture docs.
- Reworked `README.md` into a walkthrough-oriented structure with a clearer overview, step-by-step onboarding flow, command status table, and documentation map.
- Refined `README.md` messaging to position AgentOps as a broader operations foundation (evaluation + planned CI/CD, tracing, observability, and monitoring capabilities), and renamed the onboarding section to `Quickstart`.

### Fixed
- Align README quickstart workspace tree and starter bundle table with current `agentops init` templates (`model_direct_baseline`, `rag_retrieval_baseline`, `agent_tools_baseline`, and smoke datasets).

### Added
- CLI command surface with Typer stubs:
  - `agentops init`
  - `agentops eval run --config <run.yaml> [--output <dir>]`
  - `agentops report --in <results.json> [--out <report.md>]`
- Unit tests for models, YAML/config loading, and workspace initialization behavior.
- Initial documentation including generic quickstart and test running guide.
